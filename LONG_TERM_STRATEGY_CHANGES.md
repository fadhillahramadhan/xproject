# Long-Term Trading Strategy Configuration

## Overview

The trading bot has been reconfigured from a short-term day trading strategy to a long-term trend following strategy. This addresses the issue where the bot was generating sell signals on strong bullish trends due to short-term overbought conditions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Technical Indicator Parameters

| Parameter        | Old Value | New Value | Reason                                |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| SMA Short Period | 10 days   | 20 days   | Smoother, less noisy signals          |
| SMA Long Period  | 20 days   | 50 days   | Better long-term trend identification |
| RSI Period       | 14 days   | 21 days   | More stable RSI readings              |
| Data Period      | 60 days   | 1 year    | More historical context               |

### 2. RSI Thresholds

| Threshold  | Old Value | New Value | Impact                                      |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Overbought | 70        | 80        | Less frequent sell signals on strong trends |
| Oversold   | 30        | 20        | More conservative buy signals               |

### 3. Risk Management

| Parameter        | Old Value | New Value | Benefit                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Stop Loss        | 5%        | 15%       | More room for normal volatility |
| Take Profit      | 10%       | 25%       | Captures larger trend moves     |
| Min Price Change | 2%        | 3%        | Filters out minor fluctuations  |

### 4. Sell Signal Conditions (More Conservative)

#### Old Strategy Issues:

-   **RSI 73.4 = SELL** ❌ (Too sensitive for trends)
-   **Any SMA crossover = SELL** ❌ (False signals)
-   **2% drop with volume = SELL** ❌ (Normal volatility)

#### New Long-Term Strategy:

-   **RSI 80+ = SELL** ✅ (Truly extreme levels)
-   **Confirmed SMA crossover = SELL** ✅ (Requires confirmation)
-   **5% drop with high volume = SELL** ✅ (Significant moves only)
-   **Added: Strong uptrend continuation BUY** ✅ (Trend following)

### 5. New Signal Types

#### Enhanced Buy Signals:

1. **Long-term SMA Crossover** - 20 SMA crosses above 50 SMA
2. **RSI Oversold Recovery** - RSI bounces from below 20
3. **Strong Uptrend Continuation** - NEW: Buys on pullbacks in uptrends

#### Conservative Sell Signals:

1. **Confirmed SMA Bearish Crossover** - Requires 2-day confirmation
2. **RSI Extremely Overbought (80+)** - Higher threshold
3. **Major High Volume Sell-off** - 5%+ drop (vs old 2%)
4. **Long-term Bearish Divergence** - 10-day periods (vs old 5-day)

#### Strong Sell Signals:

1. **Multiple Confirmed Bearish Signals** - Requires confirmation
2. **Extreme Overbought (85+)** - Very high threshold
3. **Major Price Crash (-10%+)** - Significant drops only

## Impact on Your ANTM.JK Example

### With Old Configuration:

-   RSI: 73.4 → **SELL SIGNAL** ❌
-   Reason: "RSI Overbought"
-   Problem: Interrupts strong bullish trends

### With New Long-Term Configuration:

-   RSI: 73.4 → **HOLD/BUY SIGNAL** ✅
-   Reason: RSI below 80 threshold
-   Benefit: Stays with the trend

## How to Test

Run the test script to see the difference:

```bash
python test_long_term_strategy.py
```

## Configuration Files Changed

1. **`config.py`** - Updated all thresholds and parameters
2. **`trading_bot.py`** - Modified signal generation logic
3. **Chart display** - Updated to show new thresholds

## Benefits of Long-Term Strategy

### ✅ Advantages:

-   **Trend Following**: Stays with strong trends longer
-   **Less Noise**: Fewer false signals from market volatility
-   **Better Risk/Reward**: 15% stop loss, 25% take profit
-   **Reduced Overtrading**: More selective signal generation
-   **Captures Big Moves**: Designed for 25%+ gains

### ⚠️ Considerations:

-   **Slower Signals**: Takes longer to enter/exit positions
-   **Larger Drawdowns**: 15% stop loss vs 5%
-   **Fewer Trades**: More selective, less frequent signals
-   **Requires Patience**: Long-term mindset needed

## When to Use Each Strategy

### Short-Term (Old Config):

-   Day trading
-   High-frequency trading
-   Quick scalping
-   High volatility markets

### Long-Term (New Config):

-   Trend following
-   Position trading
-   Bull market riding
-   Lower stress trading

## Reverting Changes

To go back to short-term strategy, change in `config.py`:

```python
SMA_SHORT_PERIOD = 10
SMA_LONG_PERIOD = 20
RSI_OVERBOUGHT_THRESHOLD = 70
RSI_OVERSOLD_THRESHOLD = 30
STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE = 0.05
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE = 0.10
```

## Conclusion

The bot is now configured for long-term trend following, which should align better with your bullish analysis of ANTM.JK. With RSI at 73.4, the new configuration would likely generate a HOLD or even BUY signal instead of a SELL signal, allowing you to ride the trend higher.
